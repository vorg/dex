Unlike Us. network for alternatives in social media,The aim of Unlike Us is to establish a research network of artists. designers. scholars. activists and programmers who work on 'alternatives in social media'. Through workshops. conferences. online dialogues and publications. Unlike Us intends to both analyze the economic and cultural aspects of dominant social media platforms and to propagate the further development and proliferation of alternative. decentralized social media software. Whether or not we are in the midst of internet bubble 2.0. we can all agree that social media dominate internet and mobile use. The emergence of web-based user to user services. driven by an explosion of informal dialogues. continuous uploads and user generated content have greatly empowered the rise of participatory culture. At the same time. monopoly power. commercialization and commodification are also on the rise with just a handful of social media platforms dominating the social web. These two contradictory processes - both the facilitation of free exchanges and the commercial exploitation of social relationships - seem to lie at the heart of contemporary capitalism. On the one hand new media create and expand the social spaces through which we interact. play and even politicize ourselves; on the other hand they are literally owned by three or four companies that have phenomenal power to shape such interaction. Whereas the hegemonic Internet ideology promises open. decentralized systems. why do we. time and again. find ourselves locked into closed corporate environments? Why are individual users so easily charmed by these 'walled gardens'? Do we understand the long-term costs that society will pay for the ease of use and simple interfaces of their beloved 'free' services? The accelerated growth and scope of Facebook's social space. for example. is unheard of. Facebook claims to have 700 million users. ranks in the top two or three first destination sites on the Web worldwide and is valued at 50 billion US dollars. Its users willingly deposit a myriad of snippets of their social life and relationships on a site that invests in an accelerated play of sharing and exchanging information. We all befriend. rank. recommend. create circles. upload photos. videos and update our status. A myriad of (mobile) applications orchestrate this offer of private moments in a virtual public. seamlessly embedding the online world in users' everyday life. Yet despite its massive user base. the phenomena of online social networking remains fragile. Just think of the fate of the majority of social networking sites. Who has ever heard of Friendster? The death of Myspace has been looming on the horizon for quite some time. The disappearance of Twitter and Facebook - and Google. for that matter - is only a masterpiece of software away. This means that the protocological future is not stationary but allows space for us to carve out a variety of techno-political interventions. Unlike Us is developed in the spirit of RSS-inventor and uberblogger Dave Winer whose recent Blork project is presented as an alternative for 'corporate blogging silos'. But instead of repeating the entrepreneurial-start-up-transforming-into-corporate-behemoth formula. isn't it time to reinvent the internet as a truly independent public infrastructure that can effectively defend itself against corporate domination and state control? There are 800 members on a email list and 200-250 people attending events.,open-networks,participation-and-democracy culture-and-arts,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/6900e69e-7551-396b-7fd2-6cb77a87f499,1,,,1,1,

Deebase,IntroductionSince the emergence of the so called Web2.0. internet technologies have greatly expanded the possibilities for people to interact and discuss; but how many times have we found ourselves trapped in endless debates about everyday facts? Social networks have greatly contributed in re-shaping the idea of online interactions. but their outcomes are. most of the time. a clashing chorus of lonely voices unable to listen to each other giving rise to unfruitful exchanges of ideas. From this point of view. web-mediated interactions are still far from being efficient means of communication. confrontation and. in the end. a means for effective decision making. It’s from the analysis of current practices in online interactions that we came up with the idea of Deebase: a CMS aimed at supporting communities in fostering the exchange of ideas among their members. turning chaotic interactions into full-fledged debates. In Deebase. members of a community -whether pre-existing or newly emerging- can engage in online discussions about specific themes. compare their ideas with those of others. rank them and finally vote for their favorite ones. The whole process is supported by the use of gamification techniques which should. on the one hand. improve users’ engagement while on the other hand transform the confrontation as a deliberate act into an exciting game-like process. In developing Deebase we have envisaged three potential targets which could benefit from the adoption of the platform: online communities. private companies and public administrations.,open-knowledge,participation-and-democracy e-deliberation,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/229bca1e-67bc-de03-83ca-57c09faa81a0,1

Now workshops comprehend several processes in what can be described as a sort of self-contained system. Productive structure has evolved to the medieval model. In several small villages. in what were the Roman Provinces. the luxury villas of the aristocracy had their materials stripped off and their function transformed in workshops. where their often luxurious materials were re-used. It seems consistent with a socio-economic metamorphosis and a transposition of the production from the centre to the periphery. Our project will model this technological and socio-economic evolution using a contemporary parallel in the first case study of Apulia. Italy.The analogy used is. that during the 50s-70s the big factories of the North of Italy and the North of Europe (the big production centres). highly specialized and organized in assembly lines provoked a mass movement of labour force away from Apulia. In the 2000s we observe the reverse phenomenon. the return of the “sons” of that generation towards the South. and the periphery. This is accompanied by the opening of small new productive entities. usually benefiting from skills acquired through post-graduates studies and work experience abroad. principally in the UK.This paradigm aims to: integrate cultural heritage in modern life. creating further awareness; describe the phenomenon of modern interaction between people and landscape. and to generate awareness towards environmental issues and possible solutions.The initial output of the research will be: A 250 page photography book. which will be released on 1 August 2014.

The Forgotten Box,How much space is there in a museum? How many objects cannot find space on the exhibition showcases? Often. small objects such as fragments of metal artefacts or small glass beads or scrap of textiles do not find their way to the lit shelves of glory. Yes. these objects may not fulfil our common sense of aesthetics and significance. but is our heritage only aesthetics? And what is significance? More and more voices in the field have recently been underlying the wide range of values attributed to our heritage. both tangible and intangible. Therefore. the amount of knowledge necessary to produce these little objects is central to our understanding of and connection with our past! What and who is hidden behind those little “insignificant” objects?The forgotten box aims to re-discover the technical abilities and knowledge hidden behind any such object and give voice to the human master that made them. The project will retrace the routes of material procurement and knowledge transfer of the ancient artisans and re-install the sense of cultural belonging to the local rural areas.The case study selected for this project is a collection of objects stored at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology at UCL in London. and its associate findings stored at the Coptic Museum. Cairo.MOVImenti aims to generate:- A 3D virtual exhibition environment to be presented at the two museums and then to travel the journey of the reconstructed craftsman workshop locations and procurement route.- An educational game to be distributed on social media focussed on the production processes,open-data,participation-and-democracy education-and-skills culture-and-arts neighbourhood-regeneration,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/52749040-7a24-410d-4a36-6a308eee0036,

The clients play an important role in the setting. Not only do the clients bring in the industrial and societal relevance. also the students will get much more motivated in conducting a “real” project for a real client. The clients are also invited to visit the projects not only at the mid- and end-term exhibitions. but also during the course of the project. providing requirements. insights and feedback.Around the topics of social computing and social interaction. additional workshops and presentations are organized. for the students to get relevant background knowledge and theories as well as hands-on skills. Mid-term and end-term exhibitions are organized. for the students to show their designs to the teachers. clients. external visitors and to other students. to share the results and to get the feedback.Many of the teachers are also researchers. Their research interests are mostly coupled to the projects by the researchers proposing and supervising the related topics. Researchers can benefit from the results and in turn the research results can be used as valuable input for the projects. Researchers are also encouraged to propose the projects together to incubate the further cooperation.,open-data,health-and-wellbeing education-and-skills culture-and-arts,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/9caa2724-d43d-5970-30bd-972323ec19c5,1,,,1,,

In the spirit of social innovation the Wi-Fi town is now promoted to academia and industry as adigital community test bed and we have recently collaborated with Swansea University in developing the MonTag bilingual app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=qr.cloud.qrpedia ) that is a key tool in a digital economy research project that explores the social interactions of people's experiences in sharing their thoughts about the content they find when scanning QR codes.

 Online game for crowdsourc​ing malaria diagnosis.,MalariaSpot is an online game which directly supports malaria diagnosis. It is a ubiquitous. scalable. fast and inexpensive crowd-computing platform for medical image diagnosis. First. digitized samples (blood smears for malaria diagnosis) are acquired and distributed through the internet using basic mobile phones transformed into low-cost microscopes. Second. the image analysis is crowd-sourced from non-specialist volunteers who diagnosis the malaria by “hunting” parasites in an online game. Players are trained for one minute prior to the start of the game. Finally. artificial intelligence is used to combine the analysis from different volunteers into a single collective image diagnosis decision. By combining the clicks from enough non-expert volunteers that analyze the same image. it is possible to produce a high precision diagnosis.,open-networks,health-and-wellbeing education-and-skills science,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/e0e87a57-b9c8-0477-cd26-7a3a86348096,,,,1,,

Datademo,Three pioneers in the Finnish Open Data scene. Open Knowledg Finland. The Finnish Independency Fund SITRA and Helsinki Region Infoshare (HRI) launched new funding instrument. Datademo on Friday 7th February. They are set out to search for ideas that make use of open data in order to promote democracy and are offering developers micro funding of 2000 euros each.“Datademo is a participatory process. alike participatory budgeting. The applicants themselves take part in evaluating and deciding who will be receiving funding. On the contrary to traditional. Datademo brings out open and agile method to develop public IT systems” says Joonas Pekkanen. project manager for Open Knowledge Finland (OKFFI).OKFFI is responsible for organizing Datademo. whereas SITRA and HRI are the funders. Total amount of funding available in Datademo during the year will be 48 000 euros.The proposals for Datademo are required to use either specifically open data from Helsinki region or genrally from Finland. Another requirement is that they need to promote citizens’ possibilities to obtain information or to participate. Existing commercial products are ruled out from Datademo. but the applications may evolve to one in the future.“It’s great that HRI and SITRA see the big potential even in small ideas and want to enable open and agile chance to make them happen. Public administration has opened data on increasing pace. but it is more than often when developing applications is up to individuals and even the small expenses are left for the volunteers to pay for” notes Mr. Pekkanen.A sign of novel approach is also that the funding is paid in advance. Completing the job and reporting the results is left to happen on the basis of peer pressure. The organizers are hoping for that this arrangement reduces the risk for the developers to take action. as usually the market for democracy related applications is rather modest compared to eg. what mobile games might make in the app market.,open-networks,participation-and-democracy open-data apps participatory-budgeting social-innovations,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/7b4f000e-a725-c02e-01b3-48832800fe77,1,,1,,1,

Web portal that centralizes in one place products. services and events that help causes,www.comprasolidaria.pt has a pionner concept in Portugal: it's  the  first  web portal  that  aggregates  in  one  place  those products that help to raise money for a cause - the initial research showed that there are hundreds of products of this kind in Portugal. but there was no place were we could find them. if we wanted we needed to search numerous websites and news articles. without knowing where. or if. the information would be there.So. then came comprasolidaria.pt. and suddenly. and in a very pratical way. you can find in one place products that help numerous causes. with a search function that allows you to find them by category. by price. by cause of even by your favorite NGO.Besides the products  it also has a section in which you can find events that help causes. also something that didn't yet exist in a centralized way.Aditionally. usually people only talk about this  kind of initiatives during christmas time. but comprasolidaria.pt isn't just for christmas: it aims to make a difference all throughout the year.www.comprasolidaria.pt empowers and helps NGOs to achieve their goals: it helps in raising awareness. giving them more visibility and boosting their revenue sources.By simplifying the choice and creating direct connections between donors and NGOs mediated through the internet. this project aims to contribute to a a new era of socially conscious shopping. putting consumers one click away from numerous ways to help causes.Since it was launched in November 2012. it has helped more than 150 causes - all this has been done with zero funding so far.,open-data,work-and-employment health-and-wellbeing education-and-skills culture-and-arts finance-and-economy energy-and-environment elde,http://data.digitalsocial.eu/id/activity/816410d8-191e-96fe-5090-0616d4fce4f9,,,,1,,
